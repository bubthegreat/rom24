## Welcome to the Pyom project! ##

*rom24* is a re-authoring of the *Rom DikuMUD* derivative using python3.
We've tried to use as few external modules as
possible, but are using the excellent *Miniboa* telnet stack as our core.

The initial goal of the project is to provide a fully working copy of *Rom*, in
python, which can act as a stepping stone to help others convert their aging C
dikurivatives to a more modern language.  On today's hardware, there is little
value in over-optimizing such a small project, and a great deal to gain by
allowing fast and easy coding.

Licensing is still in force, please see the docs for licensing information.
